This program is an implementation of a binary tree in C++. It allows the user to interactively create, manipulate, and delete tree elements. Through a simple menu, the user can perform operations such as displaying the height of the tree, deleting nodes, inserting new values, and searching for specific elements in the tree.

Usage instructions:
1. Upon running the program, the user will be prompted to enter successive elements that will be inserted into the binary tree. The program stops adding elements after entering a value of 0.
2. After entering the data, the user can choose one of the options available in the menu:
    - Display the height of the tree.
    - Delete a selected node.
    - Insert a new value into the tree.
    - Search for a specific element in the tree.
    - Exit the program.
3. Upon choosing a specific option, the program executes the corresponding operation and displays the result or a confirmation message indicating the operation's completion.
